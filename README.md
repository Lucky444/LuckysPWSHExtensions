Currently, I've created 2 minor commands to help me:
	-touch [fileName]
	-nano [fileName]

touch is basiclly just the linux version, and creates a file with the specified name

nano, on the other hand, only works when git is installed and opens the nano in-terminal editor of the file you've specified
